# Presentations

## [The IoT of Today and Tomorrow](http://ryanturner.github.io/iot-talk-slides/#/)
> Over the next four years, every Memphian with public utilities will be participating in the Internet of Things. While the smart meter is the first for most, other everyday objects are being embedded with networked sensors and software controls. The IoT has yet to make a significant impact on daily life however due to privacy concerns and fear of internet dependence to turn on appliances (plus the benefits often aren't understood or appreciable). As we face this so called "trough of disillusionment", Ryan Turner will defend the Internet of Things' value today and detail the solutions for more realized benefits to the mainstream.
